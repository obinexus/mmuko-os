# MMUKO-OS Visual Design Scheme

## 1. Design Philosophy

### Overall Visual Direction

- Sacred Digital Mysticism: Blending the archaic with the futuristic, this design uses a technical yet spiritual aesthetic to mirror the project's fusion of African spiritual frameworks with radical digital systems. The style references the raw, textured sci-fi of films like 'Dune' and the conceptual depth of 'The Matrix', creating a tangible sense of a living, breathing OS.

### Content Density

- High Density: Designed for complex technical content, academic papers, and system documentation. Each slide accommodates 3-5 key points with supporting code, diagrams, and text, prioritizing information clarity and depth with a content-to-whitespace ratio of over 80%.

## 2. Color System

**Primary Colors**

- Background color: #2C2A28 (Warm dark brown - representing the earth and foundation)
- Primary color: #D48C45 (Vibrant copper/bronze - the color of digital skin and sacred technology)
- Secondary color: #A68B5B (Muted bronze - for supporting elements and boundaries)
- Accent color: #B8860B (Dark goldenrod - highlighting critical concepts and sacred knowledge)

**Text Colors**

- Dark text (for light backgrounds): #3D3B39 (Deep charcoal for contrast on light areas)
- Light text (for dark backgrounds): #EAE6E1 (Warm off-white for comfortable reading on dark backgrounds)

## 3. Font Design

**Heading Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Oranienbaum (A high-contrast serif with geometric precision, evoking a sense of digital classicism and architectural strength - for major headings)
  - Quattrocento (A classic Renaissance-style serif, lending a sense of authority and timelessness to the headings - for subheadings)

**Body Fonts**

- English fonts
  - Quattrocento Sans (A clean, humanist sans-serif ensuring high readability for dense technical text and code - primary body text)
  - Sorts Mill Goudy (A classic, highly readable serif font offering an elegant, book-like reading experience - secondary body text and quotes)

## 4. Image Style

- Abstract geometric patterns, macro shots of textured materials like metal or stone, and diagrams that blend technical schematics with symbolic art. The style should be dark, atmospheric, and rich with latent meaning, avoiding generic tech stock photos.
