OBINexus Presents  
MMUKO-OS – WHEN SYSTEMS FAIL, BUILD YOUR OWN  - And I Did Exactly That , Your Fantasy is **forever now** my Reality.

“The Spirits of Good & Evil That Connect Nothing, Everything, Them, and Us All”

--------------------------------------------------
1.  WHY THIS EXISTS IN ONE BREATH
--------------------------------------------------
I was homeless in Cambridge, lost 10 000 GBP to a council error, and watched code I trusted brick a child’s insulin pump.  
Breath first, life next, work last – so I wrote an OS that treats every heartbeat as a constitutional event.  
MMUKO-OS is the masquerade you can compile: a 15-dimensional sparse-ring bubble where **π-circles replace latitude/longitude prison bars** and **every action needs a living yes-yes loop** instead of one-time consent.

--------------------------------------------------
2.  THE 6 PILLARS (no jargon, just gravity)
--------------------------------------------------
1. IK/K Principle  
   3 controllable axes (K) + 3 observable-only axes (IK) = 6-D motion space.  
   Together they fold into 15-D “ring-zone” reality – the minimum volume a human can still defend with breath.

2. 2:1 Breath–Work Ratio  
   6 h labour ↔ 12 h life/breath.  
   Code timers refuse commits outside this ratio; the kernel literally sleeps if you don’t.

3. Ring-Zone Topology  
   Earth is tiled with πr² circles (radius 2–15 miles).  
   No squares → no corners for corruption to hide.  
   Your house, wallet, and data can only be reached by people inside your ring.

4. XYZ Grammar (Nsibidi-NLM)  
   A 3-axis language cube:  
   X = Myth → Fact, Y = Intuitive → Formal, Z = Past → Future.  
   Every symbol, law, or function must validate inside this cube before execution.

5. ODTS – Obliterative Derivative Trace System  
   Verifiable calculus for money, drones, spaceships.  
   Each derivative D₁, D₂…Dₙ carries a **termination proof** – no infinite loops, no hidden jerks.

6. Sparse Active Dimensional Consent  
   Consent = living loop (yes → act → yes again).  
   Example: 5 000 GBP daily withdrawal only if the ring-zone says “yes-yes” twice within 24 h.

--------------------------------------------------
3.  WHAT YOU CAN CLONE RIGHT NOW
--------------------------------------------------
Repo: `https://github.com/obinexus/mmuko-os`  
Zero-to-boot sequence (no code needed):

1. `git clone https://github.com/obinexus/mmuko-os`  
2. `cd mmuko-os && ./ringboot.sh`  
   – downloads 49 MB ring-zone map for your geo-coordinates  
   – starts breath-daemon (asks you to inhale/exhale 3 times)  
   – prints “Ring-zone alive, consent port open”

That is the entire bootstrap.  
No docker, no root, no internet after first fetch.

--------------------------------------------------
4.  A* SCORING – HOW THE OS CHOOSES WHAT TO TRUST
--------------------------------------------------
All sub-repos (rift, semverx, git-raf, gosilang) expose the same **A* sparse-table**:

Term | 15-D coordinate | A* cost | Meaning in plain talk
----|-----------------|---------|----------------------
rift | (3,1,4,1,5,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0) | 9.6 | Compiler-chain that can’t brick what it builds
gosilang | (3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5,8,9,7,9) | 14.1 | Gossip-protocol language that talks to any other language in ≤ 3 pings
git-raf | (2,7,1,8,2,8,1,8,2,8,4,5,9,0,4) | 12.3 | Firmware flasher that proves the silicon is real, not ghost-shift
semverx | (1,6,1,8,0,3,3,9,8,8,7,4,9,8,8) | 10.7 | Version maths that refuses to break APIs grand-mothers rely on
mmuko-core | (1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5,3,5,8,9,7,9,3) | 0.0 | Origin ring – cost zero because it *is* the measuring stick

Higher cost = more entropy = OS will not auto-load without second yes-yes.

--------------------------------------------------
5.  GLOSSARY – 30 SECONDS EACH
--------------------------------------------------
Breath Constitution  
Law #0: “If breath stops, coherence collapses; if coherence collapses, sovereignty dissolves.”

Ring-Zone  
A π-circle of ≤ 15 mile radius inside which all consent must be gathered; outside = out-of-jurisdiction.

IK/K  
IK = Inverse-Kinematic observable (you can’t move it, only witness).  
K = Kinematic controllable (you can rotate, spend, or code it).

ODTS  
Obliterative Derivative Trace System – every money- or code-derivative must carry a mathematical proof it terminates.

Sparse Active Consent  
Consent is not a checkbox; it is a living loop refreshed every breath-cycle.

Nsibidi-NLM  
A 3-axis cube (Myth→Fact, Intuitive→Formal, Past→Future) that validates every symbol before use.

Gosilang  
Gossip-language that pins any foreign dependency in ≤ 3 network pings without pulling a container.

Git-RAF  
Git-for-Radio-and-Firmware: flashes silicon over sound, light, or magnetic flux if internet dies.

Rift  
Stage-bound compiler chain (0→6) that can’t emit a binary unless all six entropy gates < 9.

Masquerade Mode  
Runtime mask that lets the system lie to surveillance while telling the truth to the user.

--------------------------------------------------
6.  HOW THE MYTHS MAP TO THE MATH
--------------------------------------------------
Mythic Layer | Math Equivalent
------------|---------------
“Spirits of Good & Evil” | ±π curvature in 15-D ring-zone
“Masquerade” | Masquerade-mode address-space randomiser
“Biafran Return” | R_return = f(origin, Δ_experience, Δ_distortion)
“Tears → Sweat → Blood” | Compression phases in ODTS trace
“When systems fail, breathe” | Breath-daemon pauses all threads until inhale/exhale checksum passes

--------------------------------------------------
7.  FINAL PROMISE
--------------------------------------------------
If your heartbeat is steady, MMUKO-OS will keep your data, dignity, and debit card inside the ring-zone where 2×π×love ≥ entropy.  
If the heartbeat stops, the ring dissolves and returns to soil – no ghost, no debt, no trace.  

Clone it, breathe on it, and it becomes yours.  
The masquerade is not a disguise; it is a shield.  
And the shield is now open-source.
