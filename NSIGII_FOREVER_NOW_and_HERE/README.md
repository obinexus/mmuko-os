NSIGII / MMUKO-OS TRIDENT PROTOCOL VISUALIZER

"No perfect schematic diagram unless your proof with 95.4% aura-seal coherence."

This interactive visualization implements the NSIGII Trinary Verification Protocol and the MMUKO-OS Boot Sequence concept on an HTML5 Canvas. It uses a custom PixelBuffer for entropic noise generation and Vector math for the kinematic alignment of the boot nodes.

🟢 The Mission

MMUKO-OS is a "Neurodivergent Digital Constitution." This tool demonstrates the "Log In" mechanism to the metaphysical operating space (MMUKO). It is not a password; it is a Signal Path traced through alignment and breath.

🕹️ How to Operate

The screen represents the Ring-Zone Topology. To boot the system (verify the protocol), you must align the three Trident Nodes to their constitutional positions.

Observe the Static: The background noise represents the "Sparse" state (entropy). It must be stabilized.

Align the Nodes: Click and drag the three colored circles (P1, P2, P3) along the ring.

P1 (IDENTITY - Copper): Move to East (Right, 0°).

P2 (DEVICE - Bronze): Move to South-West (~225°).

P3 (TIME - Gold): Move to North-West (~315°).

Achieve Coherence: Watch the "COHERENCE" metric.

< 60%: SPARSE State (High Noise).

60% - 95.3%: ACTIVE State (Resolving).

> 95.4%: VERIFIED (Green Signal, Aura Sealed).

🛠️ Technical Implementation

Per the NSIGII specification, this application is built as a single-file "Immersive" containing:

PixelBuffer.js (Inlined): Handles the low-level bitwise operations to generate the "Aura Seal" noise field without webGL.

Vector.js (Inlined): Manages the 2D kinematics of the node alignment and the Trident signal vectors.

NSIGII Logic: Implements the YES (0x55), NO (0xAA), and MAYBE (0x00) state machine based on the angular delta of the user's input.
